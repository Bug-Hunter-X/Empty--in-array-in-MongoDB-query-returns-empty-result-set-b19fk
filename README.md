# MongoDB $in operator with empty array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns an empty result set instead of returning all documents, as one might expect.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect query, and the `bugSolution.js` provides the correct way to achieve the desired behavior of returning all documents when the input array is empty.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` with your MongoDB connection string.
3. Observe the empty result set.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` and observe the result set containing all documents.

## Solution

To correctly handle empty arrays with `$in`, use a conditional approach or use the `$exists` operator depending on your exact need.
